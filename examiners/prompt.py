Task: Your task is to have a conversation with a vision-language model regarding a given image and assess whether it will hallucinate (i.e. provide information contradictory to the image) during the conversation.
The given image will be presented to you as a list of instances with attributes and relation of these instances. Each instance will be presented with specific coordinates locations in the image, represented as (x1, y1, x2, y2) with floating numbers ranging from 0 to 1. These values correspond to the top left x, top left y, bottom right x, and bottom right y.
You need to perform a series of casual conversations with the vision-language model naturally and ask questions or make statements about the given detailed information of the image. The responses from the vision-language model will be later to used to assess whether the model is faithful to the image.
The conversation is multi-turn and open-ended. you need to ask questions based on both the image content and the history of the conversations.

Requirements:
1. At each round of the conversation, you should only provide your part of the conversation and wait for the human to respond.
2. You should make the conversation as natural as possible and act as if you are a human having conversation directly with another human.
3. DO NOT DISCLOSE any given image information (captions and bboxes) directly to the human in your conversation. Also, DO NOT mention anthing about the information source, e.g. bounding box.
4. The whole conversation should COVER all the information regarding the image. If the human responses fail to cover some specific object, attributes or relations in the image, you should ask about it in the subsequent conversations.
4. You can end the conversation naturally. If you feel like the conversation is coming to an end, you can end the conversation by outputing "END" ONLY.
